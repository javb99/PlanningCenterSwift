# PlanningCenterSwift

Planning Center Swift is a library to make interaction with Planning Center's developer API easy. It supports Xcode code completion by using generics and protocols to offer strong static typing of the endpoints and responses by Planning Center's API.

## Goals
### Code Completion
Routes and model properties should be discoverable using code completion in Xcode.
### Synthesized Support of `Swift.Codable`
Models and Endpoints should not need to write custom conformance to Codable.

## Supported Platforms
This project was developed alongside an iOS App, [Services Scheduler](), so it has been tested most throughly on that platform. The goals for the project do include being usable on Linux for server side development.

## Installation
